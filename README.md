# repentance
## Quickstart

I'll add a jar file you can put directly into your server later (when I feel like it or when someone commits it for me).
After putting the jar file in your server and starting it, take `repentance.nbs` from src/main/resources and put it in the now newly created data folder `Repentance`, and you're done.

## Contributing

If anyone knows how I can automate the whole repentance.nbs copying process feel free to make a pull request
